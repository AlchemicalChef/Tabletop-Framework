Key characteristics: (1) Highly targeted spear-phishing with industry-specific lures, (2) Custom malware and Cobalt Strike for persistence, (3) Extensive reconnaissance before fraud execution, (4) Sophisticated understanding of banking operations. FIN7 has compromised over 100 US companies and stolen over $1 billion globally. The scenario emphasizes the "low and slow" approach where attackers spend weeks learning internal procedures before executing fraud.'
