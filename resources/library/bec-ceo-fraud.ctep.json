The receiving bank has the funds, but whether they can freeze them depends on:\n- Whether the beneficiary account still has the funds\n- Whether the receiving bank will cooperate\n- Whether there's a legal hold in place\n\nIn BEC cases, funds are typically moved within hours to other accounts, often overseas. By Monday morning, the money has usually been moved several times.\n\nWe'll do everything we can, but you should prepare for the possibility that these funds are not recoverable. I'm also required to file a Suspicious Activity Report.\n\nYou should contact:\n1. FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)\n2. Your cyber insurance carrier\n3. Your legal counsel\n\nI'm sorry.
